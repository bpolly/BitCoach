# Setup

Install all dependencies with `npm install`. When you add a new package, be sure to use `--save`

For the **front end**, you need to install bower and the appropriate bower components. If you don't have bower, try `npm install bower`. One you have it, just do `bower install` and it will install the front-end dependencies. The same `--save` rule applies here too.
